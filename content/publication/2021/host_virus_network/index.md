abstract: Better methods to predict and prevent the emergence of zoonotic viruses could support future efforts to reduce the risk of epidemics. We propose a network science framework for understanding and predicting human and animal susceptibility to viral infections. Related approaches have so far helped to identify basic biological rules that govern cross-species transmission and structure the global virome. We highlight ways to make modelling both accurate and actionable, and discuss the barriers that prevent researchers from translating viral ecology into public health policies that could prevent future pandemics.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Review proposing a framework which unifies a number of recent approaches for understanding and predicting human and animal susceptibility to viral infections.

  caption: "Studies can use data describing known host–virus interactions to predict potential cross-species transmission. Several approaches involve predicting the structure of host–virus association networks (depicted here using real associations known from large datasets in disease ecology), including zoonotic risk prediction (A: can a virus infect humans?) and reservoir identification (B: where does a zoonotic virus come from?); work trying to predict viral host range (C: how many hosts?) and viral diversity (E: how many viruses?); and viral sharing analysis (D: which hosts share viruses?). All of these are subsets of a general problem (F): the prediction of bipartite network links, as a way of representing host–virus associations. Approaching these problems as general link prediction may lead to new insights, especially when considering a more complete network. For comparison, we show the full range of recorded interactions compiled across the HP3 database (G: black lines match the smaller examples, but additional known links are added in grey), for example a recent link prediction study found a high probability that two of these viruses (bovine viral diarrhoea disease virus 1 and bluetongue virus, red links) may have undiscovered zoonotic potential (red lines in ref. 37). Light and dark blue nodes on the right (G) represent the same viruses and hosts, respectively depicted on the left (A–F)."
