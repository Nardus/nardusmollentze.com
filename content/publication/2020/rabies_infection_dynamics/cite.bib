	abstract = {Emerging disease epidemics often result from a pathogen establishing transmission in a novel host species. However, for reasons that remain poorly understood, most cross-species transmissions fail to establish in the newly infected species. Examining experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, we show that host and viral factors predict differences in disease progression in ways that are expected to impact the likelihood of onward transmission. Disease progression was accelerated and virus excretion decreased when the reservoir and novel host were physiologically or genetically more dissimilar. These insights may help to explain and predict host shifts in rabies and other zoonotic viruses and highlight meta-analyses of experimental inoculation data as a powerful and generalizable approach for understanding the dynamics of index infections.Whether a pathogen entering a new host species results in a single infection or in onward transmission, and potentially an outbreak, depends upon the progression of infection in the index case. Although index infections are rarely observable in nature, experimental inoculations of pathogens into novel host species provide a rich and largely unexploited data source for meta-analyses to identify the host and pathogen determinants of variability in infection outcomes. We analyzed the progressions of 514 experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, a widespread zoonosis which in nature exhibits both dead-end infections and varying levels of sustained transmission in novel hosts. Inoculations originating from bats rather than carnivores, and from warmer- to cooler-bodied species caused infections with shorter incubation periods that were associated with diminished virus excretion. Inoculations between distantly related hosts tended to result in shorter clinical disease periods, which are also expected to impede onward transmission. All effects were modulated by infection dose. Taken together, these results suggest that as host species become more dissimilar, increased virulence might act as a limiting factor preventing onward transmission. These results can explain observed constraints on rabies virus host shifts, describe a previously unrecognized role of host body temperature, and provide a potential explanation for host shifts being less likely between genetically distant species. More generally, our study highlights meta-analyses of experimental infections as a tractable approach to quantify the complex interactions between virus, reservoir, and novel host that shape the outcome of cross-species transmission.Raw data and all data processing and analysis code have been deposited in Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3746609).},
