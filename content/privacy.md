This website does not employ trackers, and avoids placing cookies as far as possible. However, some content is hosted externally, and cookies will be placed when interacting with these unless your browser is set to [block third party cookies](https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/online/cookies/):
- Some dataset pages contain R Shiny apps. These are loaded from [www.shinapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io), which places cookies and assumes agreement with the [RStudio terms of use](https://www.rstudio.com/about/rstudio-service-terms-of-use/).
- The "media coverage" page contains placeholder images in place of videos to avoid transferring data to YouTube unnecessarily. Clicking on these will load YouTube's embedded video player, and implies consent to their [terms and conditions](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) (summarised [here](https://tosdr.org/en/service/youtube)).

Finally, a cookie is placed directly by this website when you dismiss the cookie notice banner. This avoids showing the banner on repeat visits, and expires after 7 days.
