# Brief description:
abstract: "Distribution of rabies incubation and clinical period durations, derived from experimental within- and cross-species infections. Data collection is described in [Mollentze et al. (2020)](DOI_LINK). 


*Observations for individual inoculated animals are shown in grey, arranged vertically by event time to approximate a survival curve. Where censoring applies, the range is shown as a horizontal line. Interval-censored times are placed using the midpoint between their possible start and end times, while right-censored times are arranged using the time of censoring. Distributions are fit in R using `fitdistcens()` in the `fitdistrplus` library. Code archived at DOI [10.5281/zenodo.3746609](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3746609).*"
